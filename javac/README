The javac Wrapper Project

The OpenJDK project at https://jdk-jrl-sources.dev.java.net/ has a source 
base which consists of several separately-buildable projects; "langtools" 
is the project where the javac source base and build reside.  This project 
wraps the "langtools" to integrate the javac build into the OpenJFX Script
compiler project's build.


Initializing This Project

This project requires the full "langtools" source, tag jdk7-b21, to be in 
langtools/.  There are two ways to set this up:

1.  Use Subversion (preferred):

svn checkout https://jdk-jrl-sources.dev.java.net/svn/jdk-jrl-sources/jdk7/tags/jdk7-b21/langtools --username 

2.  If you already have a local copy of the OpenJDK source base, link or
copy it to langtools/ from this directory:

Unix/Linux/Mac OS X/Cygwin:  ln -s OPENJDK_ROOT/langtools

Windows: In the Explorer, copy the "langtools" directory from OpenJDK
         directory and paste it this directory.


Apply JavaFX Script javac Patches

From the command-line (patch must be available):

        $ cd langtools/src/share/classes
        $ patch -p0 < ../../../../javac-for-jfx.patch

                                -- OR --

In NetBeans, open the JavaFX Compiler project, change to the Files panel, 
and select JavaFX Compiler->javac/langtools/src/share/classes.  Right-click 
on that directory, run Tools->Apply Diff Patch.


Building the "langtools" workspace.

The "langtools" workspace can be built using build.xml with NetBeans, 
the command line with Ant, or with any IDE that support Ant-based projects.
