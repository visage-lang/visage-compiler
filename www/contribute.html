<h1 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How to Contribute to the OpenJFX Compiler Project</h1>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This page describes the contribution process for the OpenJFX Compiler
project. This interim process will be used until an open governance
model for the project is established.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The design of this process is based loosely upon the
contribution process of the <a href="https://openjdk.dev.java.net/contribute.html">OpenJDK</a>
project. </p>
<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">0. Become a contributor</h2>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Like many other open-source projects, the OpenJFX Compiler project
requires contributors to jointly assign their copyright on
contributed code. If you haven't yet signed the <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/sca.pdf">Sun Contributor
Agreement</a> (SCA) (<span class="style1">verify URL</span>) then please do so and fax it to
  +1-408-715-2540, or scan it and e-mail the result to
sun_ca(at)sun.com.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SCA gives Sun and the contributor joint copyright interests
in the code. The contributor retains copyrights while also granting
those rights to Sun as the project sponsor. You only need to sign
the SCA once in order to cover all changes that you might
contribute to any Sun-sponsored open-source project including not
just the OpenJFX Compiler project but also, for example, <a href="http://glassfish.dev.java.net">GlassFish</a>, <a href="http://netbeans.org">NetBeans</a>, and <a href="http://opensolaris.org">OpenSolaris</a>. If you've already signed
the SCA in order to contribute to some other Sun-sponsored project,
then you do not need to sign it again in order to contribute to the
OpenJFX Compiler project.</p>
<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1. Find something interesting to work on</h2>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most obvious thing to work on is a bug or enhancement (RFE)
about which you are passionate. Please check the "javafx-compiler" component of
the online <a href="https://openjfx-compiler.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">bug database</a> to see if
your idea is already described there, and if so then use that
bug/RFE's id number when writing about your work.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If you're interested in a particular area but don't have any
specific ideas about what to do, then feel free to post a query to
the appropriate <a href="https://openjfx-compiler.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">development mailing list</a> to ask for suggestions that match
your skills and knowledge.</p>
<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2. Submit a test</h2>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If you have some JavaFX Script source code that does not compile correctly, attempt to trim the file down to the main problem, and attach it to an issue describing the problem. We'll add that file to our test suite. </p>
<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3. Discuss your intended change</h2>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before you invest time working on a change, discuss what you're planning to do with other engineers working on the same code. They're
likely to be able to offer comments and suggestions that will
result in a higher-quality change and a smoother submission
process. Announcing that you're working on a particular item can
also help to avoid wasted effort in case someone else is already
working on it.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If you're thinking of working on an existing bug or RFE, then the
best way to start such a discussion is to post a message to the
appropriate <a href="https://openjfx-compiler.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">development mailing list</a> with a subject line of the form</p>
<blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><tt><span class="param">IssueID 210</span>: <span class="param">My favorite bug</span></tt></blockquote>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">where <tt class="param">210</tt> is replaced with the actual
bug or RFE id number and <tt class="param">My favorite bug</tt> is
replaced with the bug or RFE's synopsis.</p>
<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4. Submit a patch</h2>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When your change is ready, send a message to the appropriate <a href="https://openjfx-compiler.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">
development mailing lis</a>t with a subject line of the form</p>
<blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><tt>[PATCH] <span class="param">210</span>:
<span class="param">My favorite bug</span></tt></blockquote>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">where <tt class="param">210</tt> and <tt class="param">My
favorite bug</tt> are replaced as above. If no existing bug or RFE
describes your change then omit the id number and one will be
created and assigned.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The message should contain the following two things, either directly in the
body or as attachments:</p>
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="spread">
<li>A description of the change, including a rationale for your
approach, and a discussion of any alternative approaches that were
considered, if relevant. If there is no existing bug or RFE already describes your
change, then also include a description of the problem that it
solves or the need that it addresses.</li>
<li>Diffs of the code changes, in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_mono/diff.html#Unified%20Format">
unified diff</a> format (<tt>-u</tt>). Be sure to identify the
baseline version for your diffs by mentioning its build number
(<tt>b02</tt>, <tt>b03</tt>, etc.), which you can find in the name
of the source bundle you that started with. If you're using a
working copy of the <a href="https://openjfx-compiler.dev.java.net/source/browse/openjfx-compiler">Subversion
repository</a> then you can find the build number in the output of
the <tt>svn&#160;log</tt> command, and diffs in the required format
can be generated via the <tt>svn&#160;diff</tt> command.</li>
</ul>
<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5. Work with your sponsor</h2>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A Sun engineer whose knowledge and skills are a good match for
your proposed change will be assigned as your <i>sponsor</i> and
will reply to your message.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You can generally expect a reply within about five working days.
Actual response times will vary due to factors, such as impending
product-release deadlines, contribution volume, and holiday
schedules. You should also expect a longer response time if you
haven't already discussed your proposed change on the appropriate
development list, since it will take more time for your sponsor to
come up to speed on what you're trying to do.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Your sponsor will first evaluate your patch for correctness,
compatibility, stability, performance, coding style, and overall
appropriateness to the current phase of development. If your change
passes inspection then your sponsor will work with you to address
any minor deficiencies and then guide you through the rest of the
development process, navigating the relevant internal Sun
engineering processes on your behalf and ultimately, if all goes
well, integrating your patch into the JDK.</p>
<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6. Know what to expect</h2>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Only the best patches submitted will actually make it all the
way into the OpenJFX Compiler source base. Sun's goal is not to accept the
maximum number of contributions possible, but rather to accept only
high-quality contributions that improve the JavaFX compiler.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If you're relatively new to the Java platform and the JavaFX Script language, then we recommend
that you gain more experience writing Java and JavaFX Script applications before you
attempt to work on the OpenJFX Compiler itself. Sun's aim here is to bring
developers who already have the skills required to work on the OpenJFX Compiler
into the existing OpenJFX development community. The members of that
community have neither the time nor the patience required to teach
basic Java programming skills or platform implementation
techniques. (Sun offers <a href="http://www.sun.com/training/catalog/java/index.xml">formal
Java language training</a> if that's what you're looking for.) You can learn the current JavaFX Script language implementation by visiting the <a href="https://openjfx.dev.java.net">OpenJFX web site</a>. </p>
