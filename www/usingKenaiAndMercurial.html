<p><br>
We now have a compiler project on server kenai.com: <a href=http://kenai.com/projects/openjfx-compiler><b>JavaFX Script Compiler</b></a>
<br>The marina master repository is available for browsing or cloning:
<DIV CLASS="indented">
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler~marina-master">http://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler~marina-master</a><br>
</DIV>
<br>

The <a href=http://openjfx.java.sun.com/hudson/job/openjfx-compiler>Hudson builds</a> are also available.

<b>'Developer' status in this new project will be by invitation from the compiler team, at least for the time being.</b>
<br>
<br>
If you have any questions, please email <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:jim.holmlund@sun.com">jim.holmlund@sun.com</a>
or <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:robert.field@sun.com">robert.field@sun.com</a><br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b>Which Mercurial?</b><br>
The kenai server does not support pushes using ssh which means that clones are done with http but pushes have to be done with https, E.G<br>
</p>
<DIV CLASS="indented">
hg clone <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
 href="http://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler%7Emarina-master">http://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler~marina-master</a>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="indented">
hg push <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
 href="https://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler%7Emarina-master">https://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler~marina-master</a>
</DIV>
<p>Older versions of mercurial do not support https, at least not on Solaris. </p>

<p><b>Solaris</b><br>
Neither hg version .95  nor hg version 1.0.1 works on Solaris with https.  Instead use:<br>
<DIV CLASS="indented">
    Solaris 10:&nbsp; /pkg/local/bin/hg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is hg 1.1.2<br>
    Solaris 11, Open Solaris:  /usr/bin/hg
</DIV>
<p><b>If you see this error:</b><br>
</p>
<DIV CLASS="indented">
    hg push <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
     href="https://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler%7Emarina-master">https://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler~marina-master</a>
  <br>
    abort: Python support for SSL and HTTPS is not installed
</DIV>

you are using a too-old version of Mercurial, E.G .95.</b>

<p>
<b>Windows/ MacOS/Linux
<br>
</b>You can download from here:
<DIV CLASS="indented">
    <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
     href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/BinaryPackages#head-adac70dc1664bb9eac334d5c8b57483d300254f3">http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/BinaryPackages#head-adac70dc1664bb9eac334d5c8b57483d300254f3</a><br>
</DIV>

<p><b>~/.hgrc</b><br>
You also need a .hgrc file in your home directory containing at least:
</p>

<pre>[ui]<br>username = &lt;&lt;your hg user name&gt;&gt;</pre>
<p>Your 'hg user name' is the name that will appear in the change logs for the project and should be personally identifiable.  For example
<br>
username = Fred C Dobbs &lt;freddy@sierramadre.com&gt;
<br>or<br>
username = fredcdobbs
<br>
instead of
<br>
username = BigAloha
<p>
You can search the internet and read the Mercurial documentation mentioned below to see more things you can put into your
~/.hgrc.<br>
</p>

<b>Username/password on kenai<br>
<br>
</b>You have to create an account on kenai with a user name.
Note that this kenai username is <b>not</b> the user name that will appear in hg changesets. That name comes
from your .hgrc file.  As with the .hgrc user name, it would be nice if your kenai user name was personally identifiable,
or maybe even the same as your .hgrc user name.
<br>
Also bear in mind how your kenai user name will be used:<br>
 - to login to kenai<br>
 - to 'join' a project, in kenai forums, etc.  It is your identity on kenai.<br>
 - to do mercurial pushes.&nbsp; You have to enter your kenai user name (and your password) every time you do a push.<br>
 - in the email sent out to announce a push. This email will be 'From'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; username@kenai.com<br>
    People can reply to these email messages; kenai will forward replies to your registered email address.<br>
<p>

To get an account on kenai, browse to kenai.com and:

<li> If you <b>do not </b>have a Sun Developer Connection account, click the Sign Up button and create a kenai account.
It will ask you to create your kenai user name.  

<br>
<li> If you <b>do</b> have a Sun Developer Connection account 
click on the login link and login with the email address connected to your SDN account, and your SDN
password.  When you login the first time, kenai will ask you for a user name.  See info above
about what user name to choose.


<p>Since the kenai server does not support ssh, you have to enter your
kenai username and password each time you do a push.<br>
Here is how you enter your kenai username/password during an hg push:<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp; hg push <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
 href="https://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler%7Emarina-master">https://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler~marina-master</a><br>
</p>
<blockquote>pushing to <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
 href="https://kenai.com//hg/openjfx-compiler%7Etest-marina">https://kenai.com//hg/openjfx-compiler~test-marina</a><br>
searching for changes<br>
http authorization required<br>
realm: Mercurial Repository<br>
user: &lt;&lt; your kenai user name &gt;&gt;<br>
password: &lt;&lt; your kenai password &gt;&gt;<br>
adding changesets<br>
adding manifests<br>
adding file changes<br>
added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files<br>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
You can also embed your kenai username in the hg push command, for
example:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hg push <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
 href="https://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler%7Emarina-master">https://fredcdobbs@kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler~marina-master</a><br>
<br>
In fact, we have reports  of cases where on windows, if you <b>don't</b> embed your kenai user name in the URL, hg hangs and uses 100% of the CPU!
<br>
You can also embed your password:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hg push <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
 href="https://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler%7Emarina-master">https://fredcdobbs:GiveMeTheGold@kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler~marina-master</a><br>
<br>

<br>NOTE:  I have not been able to do a push on Windows from an xemacs shell buffer running cygwin. It appears that hg or ??? can't read input in this
case.  It works ok if I do the push in a cygwin command window.  If you know how to fix this, please let us know!

<b>A Few Notes on Using Mercurial</b><br>
<br>
NOTE:  We have a test repository that you can use for testing without worrying about breaking something.
It is here : 
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
 href="http://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler%7Etest-marina">http://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler~test-marina</a><br>

<b>If you push to it, be very sure that you are pushing to it and not to the marina-master!</b>
<br><br>
Following are a few notes about common Mercurial operations.  But you really should read the documentation referenced in the <b>Additional Information</b> section which follows.
<p>
Every Mercurial repository has a complete "clone" of the
repository, with full history, which is stored in the .hg
directory.  This clone is a full-fledged repository,
which you can check your changes into, and use to create yet
more repositories wherever you want.  Checking in a change is a two stage 
process: You "commit" your changes from your
working directory into a changeset in your private repository, and then you
(optionally) "push" your changesets from your local repository to
some other repository, usually the master repository on kenai.
But there is nothing special about the master repository - you
can create as many repositories as you want, and you can "push"
your changes into as few or as many as you have write access to.
(One advantage of this model is you can commit a lot of changes
while off-line, and then "push" a whole batch later when you're
online again.) 
<p>You can get help from hg by doing <b>hg help [command]</b>
<p>To get a clone of the compiler repository, do this:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>hg clone <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
 href="https://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler%7Emarina-master">http://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler~marina-master</a><br>
</b><br>

To make a change, just edit files. To see what changes have been made:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>hg status</b> <br>
<br>
To discard your edits in filename:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>hg revert filename</b><br>
<br>
To create a changeset of your changes, use <b>hg commit</b>.
hg commit just creates a changeset in your local repo; it doesn't push
the changeset to the 'parent':<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>hg commit -m "your commit comment"</b> <br>
<br>
To actually push your new changesets to the master, you would then do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>hg push <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
 href="https://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler%7Emarina-master">https://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler~marina-master</a></b><br>
<br>
Sometimes this will fail because someone else pushed a change between your commit and
your push. To avoid this, you should do these three commands as
quickly as possible<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>hg pull -u&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # to pull down
any changes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; hg commit -m "comment"&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; hg push <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
 href="https://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler%7Emarina-master">https://kenai.com/hg/openjfx-compiler~marina-master</a></b><br>
<br>
If the push fails, then do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>hg rollback</b><br>
to undo your commit and try again by repeating the pull, commit, and
push.<br><br>
It is possible to do several commits before you do a push, but you can run
into frequent merge situations.
If you like to do this, consider use of the mq Mercurial extension
which allows you to queue up commits without actually doing them.<br>
<br>
That <b>-u</b> in the hg pull is important.&nbsp; Without that, <b>hg pull</b> pulls
down changes but doesn't update your working files.<br>
<br>
It is sometimes a good idea to include a -v on pulls and pushes to see
just what is being done,<br>
E.G.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>hg pull -v -u</b><br>
<br>
You can also see what has changed without actually pulling the changes:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>hg incoming -v</b><br>
<br>
And you can see what a push would do with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>hg outgoing -v</b><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Additional info:</b><br>
- Forest Extension.  The forest extension supports a 'forest' of mercurial repositories. It adds new commands to Mercurial that operate on an entire forest instead of a single repository, for example <b>hg fclone, hg fpull -u</b>. Forests are used by the JavaFX SDK and OpenJDK.
They aren't used (yet) by the compiler project.  You can get the forest extension here:<br>
<DIV CLASS="indented">
    hg clone <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
    href="http://bitbucket.org/pmezard/hgforest-crew">http://bitbucket.org/pmezard/hgforest-crew</a><br>
</DIV>
<p>This creates a repository called hgforest-crew containing among
other things, file forest.py.  You would then put the pathname of this forest.py file into the extensions section of your .hgrc file, E.G.
<br>
[extensions]
<br>
forest=..../forest.py

The first five chapters are a must read.  Chapter 12 talks about using the Mercurial Queues
extension (mq), which allows for management of patch queues in Mercurial.
Developers may want to look closely at the mq extension.
